 ## Project Overview:

 The housing market consistently changes, especially from year to year and there are many other features of a house that can impact the cost of a home. 
 We decided to see whether we could predict how much a house will sell based on features such as the quality, number of bedrooms, square footage, fireplaces, etc...

 This information is useful for:
 - Realtors
 - Home buyers
 - Home sellers
 - Investors

## Project Goal:
Determine whether we can predict how much a house will sell based on numerous features.

## Dataset:
Our dataset consists of houses in Ames, Iowa that were sold throughout numerous years. The dataset includes 79 characteristics/columns for 1,460 houses, including both numerical and categorical variables.
The characteristics could be grouped into separate categories:
- Geographical: Zoning classification, Neighborhood, Lot shape, Land slope, etc...
- Size Measures: Lot frontage footage, liveable square footage, square footage of the basement, etc...
- Quality Measures: Overall condition, roof material, exterior covering, utilities present, etc...
- Special Features: Fireplaces, pools, fences, elevator, tennis courts, etc...
- Status of Garage and Basement: Number of cars fitting in the garage, number of bathrooms in the basement, square footage of the finished basement, etc...
